# Card Slide Viewer

A web-based card viewer that allows users to slide through different character cards. Each card displays detailed information, including stats, rank, and a short description of the character. The project uses JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to create an interactive and visually engaging card slider.

## Features

- **Character Cards:** Displays different characters with their unique names, ranks, images, descriptions, and stats (Power, Defense, Speed, Magic, Health).
- **Slide Navigation:** Navigate between characters using next and previous buttons.
- **Dynamic Styling:** Character cards are styled based on their rank (e.g., Legendary, Epic) and element (e.g., Fire, Water), which dynamically changes the card's appearance.
- **Best Viewing:** The page is optimized for screens in landscape mode with a minimum width of 1000px. It may not display correctly on smaller screens or portrait mode.

## File Structure

- **index.html**: The main HTML file that structures the card viewer and includes buttons for navigation.
- **style.css**: The stylesheet responsible for the visual design of the cards, including background colors, borders, and hover effects.
- **script.js**: The JavaScript file that handles the logic for navigating between character cards and dynamically updating the card content based on character data.
- **characterdata.js**: Contains the array of objects representing different characters, including their stats, ranks, and other details.

## Usage

- Open the `index.html` file in a browser.
- Use the left and right buttons to navigate through different character cards.
- Each card shows:
  - Character name
  - Character image
  - Rank (Legendary, Epic, etc.)
  - Description
  - Stats: Power, Defense, Speed, Magic, and Health.

The images of the characters, as well as their descriptions and stats, are entirely fictional and AI-generated.
